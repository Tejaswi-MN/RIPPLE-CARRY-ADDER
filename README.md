# RIPPLE-CARRY-ADDER
The Ripple Carry Adder (RCA) is a basic type of digital adder used in computing  to add binary numbers. It is constructed using a series of full adders (FAs), where  each full adder computes the sum of corresponding bits from the input binary  numbers and the carry bit from the previous stage.
